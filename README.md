# Scripts I have written or optimized for bulk and single-cell sequencing analysis
## 1. 220408_STARsoloOutputSPLiTseq_MergePrimers.py
Script to merge poly-T and random hexamer barcodes that were pooled together in one well during the first barcoding step (RT reaction) of the SPLiTseq protocol as they probably originate from the same cell. The script also assigns each read to its matching sample sam file.
